Shane:
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
When I'm with you you you you...
When I'm with you

What good's a memory without you there with me?
The morning sun ain't the same without you here
You are the summer breeze
The wind blowing through the trees
You make the loneliness all just disappear

Nothing replaces your touch
Never stop believing in us
Mark:
They try to break us but we stand strong in love
Shane:
They'll be no distance too far
Mark:
I gotta be where you are 
Shane:
Right where you are, yeah

Mark:
I don't wanna face this world alone
Without you by my side
You're the only one that makes it feel like home
And I need you in my life
When you're not around I'm feeling
Like a piece of me is missing
When it feels like the day is closing in
Somehow I find the faith to make it through

Shane:
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
When I'm with you you you you...
When I'm with you

What good's a photograph if you're not in the other half?
Why even dream if I'm not dreaming of you?
You make me a better man
Promise I'll do all I can
Your love keeps bringing me closer to the truth

Nothing replaces your touch
Never stop believing in us
Mark:
They try to break us but we stand strong in love
Shane:
They'll be no distance too far
Mark:
I gotta be where you are 
Shane:
right where you are, yeah

All:
I don't wanna face this world alone
Without you by my side
You're the only one that makes it feel like home (Shane: feel like home!)
And I need you in my life
When you're not around I'm feeling
Like a piece of me is missing
When it feels like the day is closing in
Somehow I find the faith to make it through

Shane:
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
When I'm with you you you you...when I'm with you
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
When I'm with you you you you...when I'm with you

Mark:
I questioned whether time or fate
Would ever show me a sign
The moment I saw you
That's when I knew
I feel it when I'm with you

All:
I don't wanna face this world alone
Without you by my side
You're the only one that makes it feel like home
And I need you in my life
When you're not around I'm feeling
Like a piece of me is missing
When it feels like the day is closing in
Somehow I find the faith to make it through
Shane:
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
When I'm with you you you you...when I'm with you
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
When I'm with you you you you...when I'm with you
