I was found on the ground by the fountain
At Valder Fields
And was almost dry
Lying in the sun after I had tried
To climb over the wall of the fountainside
We had agreed that the council should end at three hours over time

Shoelaces were tied at the traffic lights
I was running late
I could apply for another one I guess
They say that department stores are best
But that there would be some delays
And only temporary pay

She was found on the ground in a gown made at Valder Fields
And was sound asleep
On the stairs above the door
To the man who cried
When he said that he loved his life
We had agreed that the council should take his keys to the bedroom door
In case he slept outside and was found in two days
In Valder Fields with a mountain view...
